# s2v-iia-nodejs-webchat-demo

This webchat is based on Node.JS socket.io - It integrates with Gravatar, responsivevoice TTS and Sphero's APIs via free English based commander.

To run it:

1. Clone or download Zip file
2. npm install
3. node app.js
4. Open a browser and go to http://IP:8080
5. In the browser enter a nickname and email - Ideally use an account that has a Gravatar, so that it can integrate with it and use your picture, rather than a grey faceless man.
6. Once you create a private room, it will give you a unique id, give it to a friend (make sur ethe IP address is accessible by your friend) and ask him to enter hos nickname and email as well.
7. That's it, happy chatting!


Note: Since this webchat integrates with Gravatar and responsivevoice TTS, it requires access to Internet.
